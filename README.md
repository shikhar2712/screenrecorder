# screenrecorder
It is a screen recorder which has a web page of start and stop button but I found some difficulties linking the codes with each other to work properly.


TASK:The job is to create a screen recorder that automatically uploads the footage to the cloud. It should have a file that  can opened up, with a very simple UI where one can start and stop recording, branded with the logo attached, and that does not get blocked my Windows Defender
